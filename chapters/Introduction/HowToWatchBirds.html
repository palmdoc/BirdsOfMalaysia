<h3>How to Watch Birds</h3>
Basically you really do not need anything to watch birds, just <b>interest</b>. Although having some optics (binoculars, a spotting scope or camera) will help, they also can hinder as birds easily get frightened by them. What you need is to be observant, to be quiet and make no sudden moves. Often sitting in your garden or watching from the window can be very rewarding. The kitchen window has provided my wife (and me) some of the best sights. As many of us have tinted windows, the birds cannot see us well (but remember that they have a keen sense of hearing), and these can enhance our watching.<br/>
Of course <b>making friends with</b> birds allows you to see them up close. You can encourage birds to get nearer to you by making available a bird bath in your garden, putting out fruits or seed they like. More ideas on doing this are in the section "Creating a Bird Friendly Garden".<br/>
Having a guide to help you identify birds brings more meaning to the experience. If you are more serious, <b>keep a bird journal</b> that describes the birds you have seen. This need not be a professional or scientific recording but a record of all the interesting things you have noted. Of course the best record/journal is the one that you keep in your heart. Those pictures, sights and events continue to delight me years later and are a source of reminiscence between my wife and myself.
Having some <b>optics</b> are useful to see many birds up close without disturbing them. There is a whole range out there these days and they can be pricy, thus making choosing difficult. Surf the web and read simple reviews and advice. Always buy a reputable brand and ask an experienced bird watcher for advice. The best place to buy one locally is Infinity Infocus or visit the Malaysian Nature Society nature shop. The best thing is to try out the instrument first. Make sure you feel good holding and using it. The most useful is a <b>binoculars</b>. It is important to try one out before buying. You have to balance portability (weight may be a problem for the young and for senior adults) with the amount of light it lets in (better with those that have large lenses). Consider the issue of using one with your spectacles (not always easy & the newer ones allow you to put the eye piece to your glasses without scratching them). Binoculars carry two numbers, e.g. 10 x 50. The first number (e.g. 7 or 10) refers to the power/magnification of the binoculars. The higher the number, the more powerful the binoculars (which means a 10x binoculars makes a bird appear closer than a 7x binoculars). The second number (e.g. 35 or 50) refers to the diameter (in millimeters) of the main/objective lens. The larger this number is, the more light is allowed in and you get to see a bright picture. Lenses also may be coated to allow more light in. Bigger magnification may not be better as it may be too heavy to use comfortably. 10 x 50 is a common, good
size for an adult to use. <b>Spotting scopes</b> are even harder to choose than binoculars as they are much more expensive. You can afford to make a mistake with binoculars, not a spotting scope. Spotting scopes are larger than binoculars and have to be mounted on a tripod. They
can be used from the car but are best used with the tripod. They are powerful devices that allow you to watch from far off, example watch from the shore of a lake. They really make the bird appear as though right in front of you. Of course their value for home bird watching is limited but they can help with the bird on a tree at the end of your housing estate. Spotting scopes have an additional use in that they can be used to take pictures of birds in a method called "<b>digiscoping</b>" (first started by the late Laurence Poh, a Malaysian bird watcher living in Ipoh). The final piece of useful equipment is a <b>camera</b>. If you decide to do bird photography read all the reviews first! The newer Nikon and Canon digital SLR cameras make this really an exciting hobby. Never start with anything less than a 300 mm lens, and many would say that a 500 mm is the real minimum. I find that having a 150-600 mm lens allows for more flexibility - you can shoot near and far, can do some hand held work & some with a tripod. Best to buy a second hand camera and lens first until you know what you are really looking for. You of course will need some software to help with processing of images. Simple software like ACD or IrfanView are just as good as expensive software like Adobe Photoshop. A final word - a simple, good binoculars will suffice for most of us, with a lot of nakedeye viewing in addition.
