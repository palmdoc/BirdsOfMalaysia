<h3>Some Interesting Facts about Birds in General</h3>

There are more than <b>660 different species of birds</b> in Peninsular Malaysia and 660 plus in Borneo. This makes it one of the richest regions for bird life. People from all over the world come to watch birds in the South East Asian region. In recent years there are even individuals offering commercial bird tours to enable those with limited time to see birds at the best likely sites.<br/>

Some of the birds we see are <b>migratory</b> i.e. they have come down from the north to avoid the winter. This migration usually starts in September and ends in March-April the next year. They come in large numbers, often flying solitarily, from as far north as Siberia, Mongolia and Japan. They use the Malayan Peninsula & Borneo as their land-bridge to reach Indonesia and Australia. One of the best places to watch this migration is the lighthouse on the Malacca coast. This migration flight path is called the <b>East Asian-Australian Flyway</b>. Many of course do not go further south
than the Peninsula and spend the winter in our country and, at times, in the urban garden.<br/>

Some birds are "escapees". They are not native locally but have been happy to breed in the wild for many years from released captives (escaped cage birds, also called "ex-captive stock"). A good example is the pretty Java Sparrow (Lonchura oryzivora).<br/>

There also appears to be an important difference in the flora when comparing the northern and southern parts of the Peninsula possibly due to subtle difference in weather (the northern part of the Peninsula has a more distinct dry-season). This has resulted in some difference in fauna between north and south. For example snakes like Vipers are mainly found north of Perak. One good bird example is the Red-whiskered Bulbul (Pycnonotus jocosus) which is common in Perlis and Kedah but not in Perak (except from some ex-captive stock).<br/>

In some species there is a marked difference between male and female birds. Males are usually more brightly coloured and have features to enable them to attract the females (e.g. long tail feathers).<br/>

There is a common misconception among non-bird watchers that birds sleep in their nests. Birds use nests primarily for their young. Once the young grow up and can fly, nests are usually abandoned (some are reused later for another brood). Birds sleep usually on a branch in a tree, or some on the ground (some swifts may sleep in their nests).<br/>

Generally most birds have a relatively short life span, often 3-5 years. The higher up the food chain they are the longer the life span, so birds of prey (like eagles) live much longer. Because of the short life span birds tend to breed more rapidly and often. They have a short start to finish breeding period. In this they have a much healthier parenting structure than us humans.
