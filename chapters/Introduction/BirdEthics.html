<b>Bird Ethics - How to Respect Birds</b>
We need to respect the birds that visit or live in our garden, city and jungles. Quite often birds have learnt the hard way that humans cannot be trusted and some of this learned behaviour may be incorporated into their genetic memory for their offspring. Here are some simple/basic suggestions:<br/>
1. Do not threaten a bird with your presence just to get a better view or a photograph. It is best to let the moment go and leave. More opportunities will present themselves. Long term, such a habit, will encourage birds to get closer to you and you will get even better views.<br/>
2. We are all excited when we see a nest and chicks in it. Some of the visitors to our home have been delighted to have been able to see this. However birds are very sensitive to our presence close to their young. Never disturb or touch a nest. The smell of our presence left behind can sometimes make the parents abandon the nest and young.<br/>
3. Generally avoid flash photography. It stuns and disorientates the bird. With the new generation digital SLRs, photos taken with a telephoto/
zoom lens, even in low light, can be cleaned up.<br/>
4. Never cage or capture a bird. It is impossible to understand the experience of a free flying bird being confined in a tiny enclosed space. We must work to stop the habit of selling or keeping caged birds (even those that are bought to be released for events/festivals).<br/>
