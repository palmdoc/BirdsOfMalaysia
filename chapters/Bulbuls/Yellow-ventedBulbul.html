 Vented Bulbuls are a very common garden bird in Peninsular Malaysia. 
They are predominantly brown birds, of medium size and easily recognised
 by their very pleasant, bubbly call &#8211; very much like their names 
&#8220;bulbul&#8221;. There is a patch of yellow at the vent (underside of body, 
just where the tail starts) which gives this bulbul their name. Both 
sexes look alike but you can differentiate them by their behaviour &#8211; the
 male plays the more protective role and sings much more than the 
female. They have a warm personality and know how to live for the 
moment. They make up part of the &#8220;dawn chorus&#8221; that we hear around our 
homes, singing with the rising sun &#8211; almost as though to welcome a new 
day, singing &#8220;good morning, good morning&#8221;.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><table style="text-align: left; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tr><td>Family:</td><td>Pycnonotidae</td></tr><tr><td>Scientific Name:</td><td>Pycnonotus goiavier</td></tr><tr><td>Local Name:</td><td>Merbah Kapur</td></tr><tr><td>Status:</td><td>Resident, very common &amp; found in almost all city/town gardens</td></tr><tr><td>Size:</td><td>About 20 cm (7.5 inches)</td></tr><tr><td>Key&nbsp;Features:</td><td>Brown on the upper parts.
